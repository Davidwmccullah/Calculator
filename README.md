Bobby's Calculator

I intend to use double for all calculation data-types.

I will give a warning that my calculator may not be accurate after a certain number of digits (need to run tests to see what that specific # is with my compiler).

Perhaps for a Calculator v2, id like to take in actual expressions (4 + 6 for example), but this would require complex parsing of strings. For example, I would not only need 
to check for valid inputs (i.e. no letters) but also follow PEMDAS. For example, "(3 + 3^7 - 7/62.5 + 789) / 12" would require an advanced string parsing algorithm (totally doable,
but potentially better for a v2 of this app as opposed to rewriting what I have already done).
